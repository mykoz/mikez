### Objectives:

 * Understand how TCP/IP, HTTP, and HTML make the web work.
 * Obtain, parse, and navigate HTML to extract data.


### Ideas

 * TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) lets us transmit packets of information all over the place.
 * HTTP/S (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure) runs on TCP/IP port 80/443 and has various "verbs", the most important of which for us are GET and POST.
 * HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
