Just getting started? Read this guide: [10 minutes to pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)

**Data**: Your own data! But: if you don't have movie data to work on yet, you can use some data on the top grossing 100 movies from 2013, scraped from Box Office Mojo: `2013_movies.csv`

**Challenge 5**

What director in your dataset has the highest gross per movie?
